# StellaFuelBuddy

A simple iOS companion app for vintage scooters (like the Genuine Stella 4T or Vespa) when your fuel gauge decides to quit forever.  
Instead of stressing over a dead sender or speedo, StellaFuelBuddy tracks your **mileage between fill-ups** and gives you a clean, no-nonsense log.

---

## Features
- Tracks miles automatically with GPS (no writing things down).
- Quick tap to log a fill-up (or scan an NFC tag on your scooter if you’re fancy).
- Simple history log so you know how far you’ve gone since last tank.
- Minimal UI — built for use while mounted on a scooter.

## How It Works
1. Start the app when you ride — it tracks mileage in the background.  
2. Tap **“Fill Up”** (or bump your NFC tag) when you gas up.  
3. The log resets and keeps a running tally of your mileage.
